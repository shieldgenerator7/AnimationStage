# Chant of Immortality Script

# Lyrics

(chorus)

Remembrance, part of every life

Num'rous regrets, the art of passing time

Not one forgets, spent nights of chasing days

Eternal rest, to witness being erased

To witness being erased

(v1)

It is seldom seen in this world of now

It is welcome, universe and out

It is seen, only from eyes of thine

Is it free? 'Tis only by invite

(repeat chorus)

Remembrance, part of every life

Num'rous regrets, the art of passing time

Not one forgets, spent nights of chasing days

Eternal rest, to witness being erased

To witness being erased

(v2)

It is ponderous, willing to know my fate

In its longest lingering while to wait

I can see, memory taken tolls

I'm not ready, ready to let them go

(repeat chorus)

Remembrance, part of every life

Num'rous regrets, the art of passing time

No one forgets, spent nights of chasing days

Eternal rest, to witness being erased

(repeat chorus)

# Version 3 – Twilight’s Memory Library

Summary: Twilight looks at memories of her friends, trying to resurrect them. She collects ancient artifacts of their past (receipts, clothes, favorite toys, etc) and extracts memories from them. She tries to create new bodies for them from the memories, but each time, the spell fails, and turns back into memories.

Spike, the CMC (now old), and some other ponies spend time with Twilight to convince her to let them go

Twilight travels across the land, collecting magic. She stores them in 3 separate artifacts (like in G5), and then puts her own magic into it as well, channeling it all into a spell to bring her friends back. The spell still fails.

She puts away all magic, sending each of the stones to a different place.

Then she spends time with her current friends. Then she grows old overtime, having lost her immortality magic.

Alt ending: she does resurrect her friends, and spends time with them, but the three pieces are still separate
